#Successful results:
#All 4 corners found of spawn (tests if spawn chunks deloaded or redstone should be active)
#Vanilla villager found (tests for if player has the Pixelmon config files added)
#Pixelmon statue found (ensures Pixelmon itself is installed)
#Player confirmed not in dialogue (helps diagnose if player is stuck with a TalkTime or DialogueTrigger score when one trips to 0 but not the other)
